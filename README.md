# Game Description 

Mastermind is a single-player game played via the command line. You can opt to be either the code-breaker or the code-maker. The game uses numbers 1-6 to represent colored pegs, and the code consists of a 4-digit sequence. You have 12 attempts to crack the code, and after each guess, you'll receive feedback. Clear instructions are provided at the start of each game.
